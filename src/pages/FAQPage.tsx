            <AccordionContent>
              <p>We firmly believe that our education product stands out as the best compared to other online programs. Here are our distinctive features:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
                <li>Expert instructors with formal education and extensive experience provide practical "how-to" material, ensuring valuable insights rather than generic information from self-proclaimed property enthusiasts.</li>
                <li>100% online learning, with a mix of recorded and live course content designed to maximise learning and time flexibility for busy students with commitments.</li>
                <li>Up to date course content reflecting the post-Covid landscape. The development industry has changed during Covid and some rules of the game have changed.</li>
                <li>Exceptional value for money with flexible payment options, other courses charge similar to double the cost while not providing as comprehensive a course.</li>
                <li>Detailed learning of the construction process, many other courses gloss over this very important topic or simply assign it to a PM. Construction costs can be the biggest expense of a project and where the majority of cost blowouts occur hence its importance to fully understand.</li>
                <li>Our primary purpose in providing this course is to equip students with the knowledge to be self-sufficient property developers, some other courses are thinly disguised sales pitches to invest in the educator/developers future projects and cover their own equity requirements.</li>
                <li>We offer a money back guarantee, subject to conditions.</li>
