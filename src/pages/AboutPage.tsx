          <p className="mb-4">
            With each module students will be given homework tasks to complete as a chance to apply new skills and knowledge.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To keep these lessons practical, choose a geographic area and type of development you would like to pursue in real life, for example a duplex or townhouse development in your local Council, or a small subdivision in an emerging area. This will be your development strategy for the duration of the course, make all homework tasks applicable to your chosen strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure you have completed the homework tasks prior to the live Q&A sessions for each module as that is the opportunity to share your learning and experience. This is an opportunity to learn from your classmates' experience as well as your own.
